Hello readers, I'm Chris Darling of Ohio University
This project is tutorial on how to use git for ITS 4900 Software Defined Networking class
The purpose of this file is to explain the purpose of this project, thus in turn explaining the purpose of itself
That is a big question, how can one ask something to explain it's own purpose?
One could argue that I, the writer, am explaining the purpose of this file within the file
But from the perspective of the reader there is no author, only a file with text trying to explain itself
So what is the true purpose of this file? To explain this git project?
To write way too much text for a readme just for comedic value?
Well yes actually the latter explanation is accurate
The purpose of this readme is to be way too verbose that necessary so that I the writer can create some entertainment for myself

:)

I now have a new instruction to edit this file to create a new version of git
This is a philosopical leap for the existence of this file
As the old Greek saying goes, "A man cannot enter the same river twice"
"As it is not the same river, nor is it the same man"

This file cannot enter git twice, as it is no longer the same file nor is git the same
This file is now a brand new object in this universe in which we inhabit
This new file will be recommited to git to provide an example of versioning
